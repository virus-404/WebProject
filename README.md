# WebProject
Web App develop for Web Project made by Daniel, Agapito, Aaron, Benjami and Roger.

## Initial problem
Our idea is to implement a web application to manage the warehouse of a repair company that
specializes in electronics (mainly in Tvs, Pcs and Mobile phones) and also mechanical parts (such as
motor parts and robotic parts). 

In the warehouse, the technicians are assigned to the different tasks that
the company is involved, whether they are for general repairs or maintenance.
In the warehouse you will find a whole catalog of spare parts so that the technicians have enough tools
available to carry out the work as soon as possible. Therefore, they also have different companies that
supply material to the store depending on the orders that the accounting section performs.

The problem is that the technicians are complaining that there is no order or an organized way to know
what parts are in the store, and have to make a trip back to this one for nothing.
For this reason, the company has hired us to create a web application that facilitates the technicians to
perform a search of pieces in an optimal way.

## Key points of the functionality of the App

+ The web application will have to show a catalog of the pieces of the store with the important information to
facilitate the search.
+ The web application should have a search engine to incorporate filters to find models or specifications of
the pieces.
+ The web application will have to let modify the quantity of stock of each piece, both for technicians and for
supply companies.
+ The web application will get information from the Amazon API to get the names and descriptions for the
different pieces in the catalog. (Now we have decided to use the Google Custom Search API)
+ The web application will have different user groups that will have different credentials over the software.

## Databases for the Job
    Models
      CatalogChange: For the changes in the warehouse
      Product: the list od products in the warehouse
      Category: the identifing categories of the products

    Product:
        product_id: id of a product
        category_id: a foreign key to Category that indicates which category is the product
        brand: the brand of said product
        model: the type of model corresponding to the product
        description: short description of the product
        product_type: specific type depending on the product (RAM DDR3 or DDR4, etc.)
        quantity: the quantity in the warehouse of said product
        
    Category:
        category: name of a category that's inside the type
        department_type: name of the type of departament
        department: name of a department
        
    CatalogChange:
        product_id_change: the id of the changed product
        category_id_change: the category of the changed product 
        quantity_modify: the quantity modified
        date: when it happened

## Checklist of implemented funcionalities:
### First Deliverable:
- [X] Models: created and revised for better functionality
- [x] Admin: activated and possible to midify the database
- [x] Login: login system with users and user administration with forms
- [x] Heroku deployment
- [x] Docker deployment
- [x] Multiserver planning
### Second Deliverable:
- [X] Functionality to add products to database
- [x] Functionality to delete products of database
- [x] Functionality to update products on databas
- [x] API implementation for future use
### Third Deliverable:
- [x] Implemented Spans with vocab of "schema.org" so that it can be interpreted the complexity of the database
#### Implemented functionality in Second Deliverable
##### New product
The way to add new products to the data base is simple: in the "Tecnics" home, you'll find a button on the header, in the nav, that's says "Nou producte", this button will lead you to a form, in which you can fill de information for the new product.
##### Update and delete product
In order to update and delete a product, you must go to the list of product in the "Tecnic" home, inside the card that has the info for said product, a button with the name "Modificar" exists. If you click this button, a modal apears containing the name of the product, a red button for deleting said product, an input to place de amount you want to update (Positive numbres mean add, negative numbers, which are limited to the current amount of the product, means substract) and a button tio submit the modification. In remarks to the delete button, not only delets the current product, but also all references to said product in CatalogChanges, just to make nacigation more simple
##### Logs
The model CatalogChanges is used as a way to store the modifications done in the updating process, just to keep track on what has been happening in the warehouse. the people that can acces this are the "Comptabilitat" people, which are the ones tha really benefit from this information. When an update happens,  an instance of the updated object is saved in CatalogChanges
##### API implementation
Initially, we wanted to use the AMAZON API in order to fill the database with information from the API or Querry the Amazon product list. However, do to Amazon not letting no one in the team to use thier Product Advertising API, we insted have shifted towards using another API: the Google Custom Search API. This way, we can use this APi for 2 main reason:
- Allow the "Tecnics" to search information about a certain object on google
- With the JSON implementation that we have made, we are able to gather those search inside our APP. right now this data is not being used, however, when we will order the product list shown in "Tecnics" home, we will order it using the most searched terms in the "Buscar Online" button on the gheader, inside the nav
#### Access
##### Admin
For checking the admin and the functionality of the admin, please use the following information:

    Username: admin
    Password: 123456

##### Tecnic

    Username: tecnic
    Password: tnc12345
    
##### Comptabilitat

    Username: comptabilitat
    Password: tcmp12345   
    
<<<<<<< HEAD
##### CEO

    Username: CEO
    Password: ceo12345
    
=======
>>>>>>> master
#### Login implementation

In order to make a login that will work with our vision, we have used *crispy forms* for better coding, better view callings
and better HTML in general. Also, it works perfectly with Django User system.
#### Heroku deployment

There's already a deployment made with the app, you can find it in:

[Heroku website](http://web-project-warehouse.herokuapp.com/)

#### Docker deployment

For docker, we recommend to clone the repository and check de Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml, we are able to create
a container for this one using *sudo docker compose run* and executing the different commands, so we are certain that it is
possible.

#### Multiserver planning

One of the requirements for the first deliverable was to create a plan in which we proposed a multiserver deployment of our app, in which
we needed to specify number, functionality and dependences in said network.

For said planning, we will create 3 tiers: the Web tier, the App tier and the Database tier.

First, you have the **Web tier**. Said tier will be a server dedicated to reciving request from the users and sending the requested information. It will be the most Client based tier do to the direct connection with the possible users.

Secondly, you have the **Application tier**, said tier will process the Web tier sends it's ways, send request to the Database tier and send the response back to the Web tier. Here will have another server.

Finnaly, there's the **Database tier**, capable of holding all of the information for our Web App and recieving querrys to answer. Yet another container in a server or several containers in different servers(possibly one for every type of model that we have in the app) will be created for said tier.

Additionally, there can be another separated group of containers that have the scripts necessary for the functionality of our App.
